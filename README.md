# Lidar_conversion

Our final project is to find method to convert Lidar13 depth image to Lidar14 depth image.

Data can't be published, but we use data from: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=tjZjv_qh_CE

Current Encoder is from: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07492.pdf

The png image contains evaluation of the model on 8 rgbd images, in format: rgb, lidar13 depth, lidar 14 depth, predicted depth (Ground Truth), normals of predicted depth.
